            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>My two cats are my current entertainment. Benny, well, I would best describe him as a toddler with a
                attitude in cat form. But that would be an understatement. My other cat Jax is much more relaxed
                and really is more of the typical scardy cat. </p>
            <p>Hiking and yoga are some of my favorite past times. I love being outside and enjoying nature. It helps me
                unwind and think
                plus seeing all the animals and flowers is a treat.
                Traveling would be the other and seeing how humanity likes to do things differently, when presented
                with different challenges and a different mix of people. </p>
            <p>To sum it sum it up...I think culture and humanity can be beautiful and inspiring.
                It helps to push me outside of my comfort zone and helps me to grow as a person. </p>
