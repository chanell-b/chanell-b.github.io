            <img class="initial-img" src="Profile_closeup.jpg" alt="Photo of Chanell">
            <p>Born and raised in Utah. Hiking, traveling and learning new things are what keep me curious and grounded.
                Married for almost 20 years, raised 2 children. Which has taught me more about problem solving,
                adaptability, patience and project management then any job ever could. </p>

            <p>Quality isn't just a job, it's a mindset.</p>

            <p>Building quality software has been my careers journey and will continue to play a role into the future.
