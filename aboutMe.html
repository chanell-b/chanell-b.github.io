            <img class="initial-img" src="KneelCB.jpg" alt="Photo of Chanell">
            <p>Started in customer service at Overstock.com answering phones and customer chats. With in a year they
                needed someone to run their online sales on eBay. Which I ran successfully until they decided to merge
                that process into the Merchandising teams and I became a merchandising analyst. This is where I learned
                the Oracle E-Business Suite Software and became a buyer for Overstock. During this time they upgraded
                their systems and needed software testers, which is when I found my calling.</p>
            <p>Software testing was brand new then. It didn't really have any standards or wasn't really considered
                something you could have a career in. However I found it really interesting. So I started picking up
                other skills that would help me with this thing called software testing. Such as understanding complex
                systems, logging defects, talking to developers and doing tech documentation. This continued to instill
                my love of software testing and when the project was over I decided to move from being a buyer in the
                Worldstock department to a Business Analyst to start learning more about the side of technology.
            </p>
            <p>As a business analyst I learned many new and important skills that have helped me during my journey. SQL,
                understanding process diagrams and helping do complex business documents and metrics. This is also where
                I completed my first six sigma project during one of Overstocks hardest warehouse seasons.

            <p>Eventually I went to American Express to try my hand at another company. I worked with them to help
                implement their Oracle EBusiness suite with in their Gift Card and Travelers Checks Department. Which
                was fairly complex as they have a BOM structure for manufacturing that had to be built out and
                administered.</p>
            <p>However I found that Testing Overstock's ERP systems was my comfort zone and I went back there and formed
                a Tiger team to help them protect against their external financal reports.</p>
